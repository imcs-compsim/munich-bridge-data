# munich-bridge-data
Visualisation and analysis routines for test bridge sensor data.

## Abstract
This repo collects MATLAB and Python routines to interact with the "raw" sensor data. It provides an entry point into sensor data analysis and convenient plotting functions.

The repository also contains a small set of sample data including measurements from each sensor type (acceleration, strain, force, and inclination) for one load test on 2022-04-11 sampled at 100 Hz as shown below.
