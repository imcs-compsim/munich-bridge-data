# munich-bridge-data
Visualisation and analysis routines for test bridge sensor data.

## Abstract
This repo collects MATLAB and Python routines to interact with the "raw" sensor data. It provides an entry point into sensor data analysis and convenient plotting functions. A small set of sample data is also contained including measurements from each sensor type (acceleration, strain, force, and inclination) for one load test on 2022-04-11 sampled at 100 Hz as shown below. The full data set (3TB) can be obtained upon reasonable personal request from the authors of the referenced [publication](#publication).
