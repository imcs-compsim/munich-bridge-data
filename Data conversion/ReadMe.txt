Recommended approach:

1. Open the main.m file and modify the user-input
2. Please note that you can specify a whole list of input files in the cell array 'Fn'. Matlab will process all files in this cell array.
2. The script loads data from the folder '01_Raw data' and saves the processed files in '02_Processed data'
3. A file 'log.txt' is created that contains all information from the Matlab command window. If a file cannot be loaded properly, an error is written to the log file
4. Be patient, some of the files are very large and come with long processing times
